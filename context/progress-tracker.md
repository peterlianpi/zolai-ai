# Progress Tracker

> Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.
> Active branch: `main`. `master` is the preserved archive.

## Current Phase

- In progress: P-Core context/docs/architecture overhaul (branch `main`).

## Current Goal

- Establish `main` (branch layout: `main` active, `master` archived), fill the
  six-file context set, add pcore-orchestra workflow rules, and bring docs
  (architecture, RAG/AI, security, structure) in line with the real stack.

## Completed

- Switched active branch to `main`; `master` retained as untouched archive.
- Filled six-file context set: `context/architecture.md`, `project-overview.md`,
  `code-standards.md`, `project-setup.md`, `ui-context.md`, `progress-tracker.md`.
- Added pcore-orchestra `context/ai-workflow-rules.md` + root `AGENTS.md`.
- Security scan: no hardcoded API keys found; verified `.gitignore` + `.env.example`.

## In Progress

- RAG/AI architecture documentation (`docs/ZOLAI_AI_ARCHITECTURE.md` +
  dedicated AI/RAG doc).
- Docs sweep: README, ROADMAP, TODO, SECURITY, CONTRIBUTING, docs/ structure.

## Next Up

- Reconcile `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` / `ROOT_STRUCTURE.md` with actual repo layout.
- Light code patches flagged by structure/architecture review (only clearly broken).
- Commit docs/context to `main`.

## Open Questions

- Whether to auto-track the 89 local-only untracked files (context/, desktop/,
  scripts/bible/) or keep them untracked.

## Architecture Decisions

- `main` is the active branch; `master` is preserved as archive (do not rewrite).
- Secrets come only from env/`.env`; `.env.example` holds placeholders.
- Datasets/models live on HuggingFace/Kaggle, never in git.

## Session Notes

- Orchestra subagent model cache was stale (`x-preview-f-free` removed from Zen);
  config updated to `ling-3.0-flash-fin-free` / `mimo-v2.5-free`. A process restart
  is required before subagents can spawn.
